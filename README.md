# Focus@will Custom Icons for macOS

> _Note: I have no affiliation with focus@will and these are unofficial icons I created for my personal use._

The default icon for the [focus@will macOS app](https://www.focusatwill.com/app/downloads/macos) is a low-resolution square icon. I created my high-resolution rounded versions to match the macOS icons design and made them publicly available here. There are 6 custom color variations to choose from:

## Installation

### How to replace the app's original icon with your new custom icon:

#### 1. Download the custom icon you want to use:

##### Direct Download

- Click on an icon preview or download link above to automatically start the download for that icon.

> Note: If the above links don't work for you, [let me know](https://github.com/jacobcassidy/focusatwill-custom-icons/issues). You can alternatively do a manual download of any of the icons from the `macos-icons` directory...

##### Manual Download

- Open the [macos-icons directory](https://github.com/jacobcassidy/focusatwill-custom-icons/tree/main/macos-icons).
- In the macos-icons directory, open the color variation icon file you'd like to use.
- Then click the download button on the right side of the icon file's page (see screenshot below).

#### 2. Open the focus@will app's info panel:

- If you haven't installed the [focus@will macOS app](https://www.focusatwill.com/app/downloads/macos), do so now.
- Go to your macOS applications folder, usually located at `Macintosh HD > Applications`, then right-click on the focusatwill app and select `Get Info` (see screenshot below). This will open the info panel.

#### 3. Copy and paste the custom icon over the original icon:

- In your Downloads folder, select the custom icon you just downloaded and copy it (`CMD + C`).
- Go back to the app's info panel (which you opened in step 2 above) and select the original icon at the top left.
- Press `CMD+V` to paste the custom icon over the original icon.

That's all folks! Your app is now using your custom icon.

## Q & A

### Why am I still seeing the old icon when my app's info panel shows the new icon?

After changing your icon, the old icon may still be cached in certain places in macOS. Restart your Mac to clear the caches.

### How can I revert back to the original icon?

If you want to revert back to the original icon, simply go back to the app's info panel, select the custom icon you added, and delete it (press backspace while the custom icon at the top left of the app's info panel is selected). This will delete the custom icon and the original icon will show again.

### What is focus@will

Their [homepage](https://www.focusatwill.com/) headline is **"Music to help you focus. Optimized by science."**. In a nutshell, the service provides lyricless music that has been optimized to help you maintain sustained focus. They provide 14 different channels of music from soft classical to noisy EDM. Which serves those with and without ADHD.

I personally use the service almost daily while working as a software engineer and find it helps me fall into the zone faster and stay there. They state they have more than 2 million subscribers so it seems to work for many people.

### Is focus@will free?

Focus@will offers a 28-day free trial, and then a monthly, yearly, or two year paid subscription. In the past, they publicly offered a lifetime subscription as well, which I have. But currently only offer it for VIP members. If you know you want the lifetime subscription, [send them an email](mailto:webcontact@focusatwill.com) and ask if they can send you the lifetime subscription purchase page.

### Are you a focus@will affiliate?

No, I have no financial interest in focus@will and make no money from them. I'm simply a happy user who wanted to share my custom icons with other focus@will users.

# focus@will Custom Icons for macOS

_Note: I have no affiliation with [focus@will](https://www.focusatwill.com/) and these are unofficial icons I created for my personal use._

The default icon for the focus@will macOS app is a low-resolution, square icon. I created my own high-resolution, rounded version to match the macOS icons design and made it publicly available here. There are 6 custom color variations to choose from:

## Installation

### How to replace the app's original icon with your new custom icon:

#### 1. Download the custom icon you want to use:

##### Direct Download

- Click on an icon image above to automatically start the download for that icon.
- If the above links don't work for you ([let me know if that's the case](https://github.com/jacobcassidy/focusatwill-custom-icons/issues)), you can manually download the icons from the `macos-icons` directory...

##### Manual Download

- Open the [**macos-icons** directory](https://github.com/jacobcassidy/focusatwill-custom-icons/tree/main/macos-icons).
- In the `macos-icons` directory, open the color variation icon file you'd like to use.
- Then click the download arrow button on the right side of the icon file page.

#### 2. Open the focus@will app's info panel:

- If you haven't installed the [focus@will macOS app](https://www.focusatwill.com/app/downloads/macos), do so now.
- Go to your macOS applications folder, usually located at `Mac HD > Applications`, then right-click on the focusatwill app and select `Get Info`. This will open the info panel.

#### 3. Copy and paste the custom icon over the original icon:

- In your Downloads folder, select the custom icon you just downloaded and copy it (`CMD + C`).
- Go back to the app's info panel (which you opened in step 2 above) and select the original icon at the top left.
- Press `CMD+V` to paste the custom icon over the original icon.

## Q & A

## What is focus@will

Their [homepage](https://www.focusatwill.com/) headline is **"Music to help you focus. Optimized by science."**. In a nutshell, they provide lyricless music that has been optimized to help you maintain sustained focus. They provide 14 different channels of music from soft classical to noisy EDM. Which serves those with and without ADHD.

I personally use the service almost daily while working as a software engineer and find it helps me fall into and stay in the zone faster. They state they have more than 2 million subscribers so it seems to work for a lot of people.

### How can I revert back to the original icon?

If you want to revert back to the original icon, simply go back to the app's info panel, select the custom icon you added, and delete it (press backspace while the custom icon at the top left of the app's info panel is selected). This will delete the custom icon and the original icon will show again.

### Why am I still seeing the old icon when my app's info panel shows the new icon?

Your icon may be cached in the Dock or Finder. Restart your Mac to clear the caches.
